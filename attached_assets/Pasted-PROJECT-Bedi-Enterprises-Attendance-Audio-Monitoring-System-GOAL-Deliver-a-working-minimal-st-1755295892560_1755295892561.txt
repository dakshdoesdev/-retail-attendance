PROJECT: Bedi Enterprises Attendance & Audio Monitoring System

GOAL
• Deliver a working, minimal‐style employee check-in/out web app and an admin website with a secret audio panel.
• Use free-tier hosting and keep monthly cost at ₹0.
• Build in Replit, validate with Kilo Code, then deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend).

TECH STACK
• Frontend: React + TypeScript + simple CSS (Tailwind optional for utility classes)  
• Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.io  
• Database: SQLite in dev, PostgreSQL in production  
• Storage: Firebase Storage or Railway file storage  
• Hosting: Replit (dev) → Vercel + Railway (prod)  
• Authentication: Google OAuth (employees) + simple username/password (admin)  
• Real-time: WebSocket for recording triggers

REQUIREMENTS

1. EMPLOYEE APP (Mobile-First, Basic UI)  
   • Route “/”: Google OAuth login or simple user/pass  
   • Route “/dashboard”:  
     – “I’M HERE” button (150px circle), only enabled within 150 m of shop GPS: 29.394155353241377, 76.96982203495648  
     – Status text: 🟢 “At Shop” or 🔴 “Away” + distance in meters  
     – Display today’s check-in time and hours worked  
   • Route “/history”: List of past attendance records (date, check-in/out, hours)  
   • Route “/profile”: Basic profile info + logout  
   • No recording indicators or UI around audio

2. AUTO AUDIO RECORDING (Hidden)  
   • Start recording silently on employee check-in (enter geofence)  
   • Stop recording on check-out (exit geofence)  
   • Compress audio with Opus/WebM before upload  
   • Upload to storage and link URL to attendance record  
   • Auto-delete recordings older than 7 days  

3. ADMIN WEBSITE (Desktop-First, Minimal Design)  
   • Route “/admin-login”: Username: bediAdmin, Password: bediMain2025  
   • Route “/admin”:  
     – Table of all employees with check-in/out times and hours (day/week/month)  
     – Plain UI: no animations, simple tables and buttons  
   • Footer link “System Maintenance” (plain text)  
     – On click, prompt for second password: audioAccess2025  
     – Reveal hidden audio panel  

4. SECRET AUDIO PANEL (Accessible Only After Second Password)  
   • List employees currently recording and past sessions by date  
   • “🔴 START RECORDING” / “⏹️ STOP RECORDING” buttons (WebSocket events)  
   • Playback/download for each audio file  
   • Storage usage display and manual cleanup option  

5. WORK HOUR LOGIC & FLAGS  
   • Standard shift: 9:00 AM – 9:30 PM  
   • Late if check-in after 9:15 AM, early leave if before 9:00 PM  
   • Mark `is_late` / `is_early_leave` in attendance record  
   • Weekly/monthly totals in employee history

6. SECURITY & PRIVACY  
   • Employees never see any recording UI  
   • Two-layer admin auth with session timeouts (2 hrs regular, 30 min audio panel)  
   • HTTPS in production, secure token storage  
   • Consent documentation assumed

DELIVERY WORKFLOW  
1. Scaffold in Replit using this prompt  
2. Test employee and admin flows end-to-end (check-in/out, audio start/stop, playback)  
3. Export code and validate/fix with Kilo Code  
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend to Railway, set environment variables  
5. Deliver final URLs and credentials to uncle

STYLE NOTES  
• Keep UI minimal and functional—tables, buttons, forms  
• Use clear typography and spacing; avoid heavy design elements  
• Focus on reliable functionality, not visual flair  

BUILD AND DELIVER a fully working, cost-free attendance system with stealth audio monitoring—ready for use today.
